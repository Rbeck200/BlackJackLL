I got inspired by the linked list examples we did in class today so I came home and changed it to where I no longer use 52 prefabs, but that I am down to one prefab that I just reskin
over and over again to make it change. I implemented almost all the UML classes and also impemented a bunch of the methods. I havent changed it to a Linked List yet but im working on 
it. I ran into some issues about how to properly change the sprite of the card prefab, but I was able to fix that by "making" the card and just giving the prefab the now to be used
sprite.

Was able to convert everything over into a Linked List and now im just trying to fix the bugs in my code. Trying to also refactor my shuffle code to work with the linked list properly,
seeing as it won't pass the deck back to the program so that I have no deck when it is time to deal.

Was able to figure out the problem with my deck not passing in correctly, but now i have a bigger problem. when I play the game then when ever I look at the dealers points and the 
total of thier cards it just doesnt add up. Especially since I have debugged the code so I know that it is working 100% but when I get it to screen I c ant get it to display

I was able to figure out that it was jsut my card not presenting right that was the reason for me not being able to show the cards right and now it is being diplayed right.

GOt eveything done except for the flip which I justt cant seem to get to work. It was just diplaying card backs and sometimes not even showing the cards so it is aggrivating
